Installing Project-Fifo
==============================

If you are new to Project-Fifo and want to know about the choice to use it go here (TODO).


Wait! Where Is The Automation?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We consider the installation of core Project-Fifo services (Sniffle, Snarl, Howl) as maintence tasks. Additionally because there is not a large number of hosts in the cluster, doing things manually is not an excessive amount of work. 

For infomation on installing Project-Fifo please see the Project-Fifo documents. `Installation Guide <https://docs.project-fifo.net/en/latest/general/installation.html>`_ 

.. Note:: 
   The Project-Fifo installation guide instructs you how to install the *Chunter* service. This is an automated task for us, so you may disregard that section. This guide will show you how to install *Chunter* as an Ansible role.
