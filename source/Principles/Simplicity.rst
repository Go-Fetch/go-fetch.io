Simplicity above all!
======================================


    Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. 
    --*Edsger Dijkstra*



There are a many much better written articles about the need for simplicity in highly reliable systems this will be brief.

The common approach in IT to gain resilience is to run duplicate systems in parallel. We disagree with this. Of course that is not to say we dont run things redundantly. Many things are redundant, but this is not our primary operating plan. Sure you have a second braking method on your car, but you dont plan on using it in daily operation.
