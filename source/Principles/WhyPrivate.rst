Public Vs Private Cloud
============================


    At the end of the day, we care about our data. Nobody cares about it quite as much as we do.


private vs public cloud
- control
    - stack control
    - access (dark sites)
     service prioritization


- connectivity
    - outside bandwidth is a limiter

- price
    - Not a real comparison, stop trying
